This is my capstone project for the front-end development portion of the Nashville Software School. My goal is to create a tool for songwriters that intelligently generates chord progressions from simple key and tonality selections. To do this, I will use a body of statistics gathered and published by a music theory website called Hooktheory (http://www.hooktheory.com). To summarize, the premiss of their study was to determine the frequency with which certain chords follow other chords or sequences of chords within popular music.  I have broken my project up into the following development phases:

**Phase 1**<br />
Build mechanisms that perform the following:
<ul>
  <li>return major and minor scales from key and tonality selections</li>
  <li>assign default tonality designations to each scale degree</li>
  <li>allow users to toggle between tonality options for each scale degree</li>
  <li>allow users to add and remove chords from a chord progression</li>
  <li>display the preceeding elements on the user interface</li>
  <li>provide audio playback of the selected chord progression</li>
</ul>
*Phase 1 is complete.*

**Phase 2**<br />
Design and implement the user interface:
<ul>
  <li>create a site layout using Bootstrap that is responsive, but optimised for mobile users</li>
  <li>create popovers that display fingering charts for each chord in the progression</li>
  <li>toggle the color of each scale degree based on its current tonality status</li>
  <li>create additional design elements that improve the appearance and usability of the interface</li>
</ul>
*Phase 2 is complete.*
